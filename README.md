## Features

- Keeps the original formatting as the pptx file.
- Does ***not*** use image processing, text detection or ML giving the best performance possible, even with a huge number of input names.
- Supports custom csv delimiter and input file names.
- All dependencies and the program itself is written in pure python.
- Files are saved in a pptx format for high resolution printing.
